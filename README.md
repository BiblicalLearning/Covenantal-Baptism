## 📖 About This Study

One of the most profound and often overlooked truths of Scripture is how baptism serves as the covenantal bridge between the Old and New Testaments. There are two distinct baptisms spoken of in the New Testament, and each one corresponds directly to one of the two covenants.

The baptism of repentance belongs to the Old Covenant — calling people to turn from sin and acknowledge their failure under the Law. The baptism of the Holy Spirit belongs to the New Covenant — sealing believers into the grace and life that Jesus established through His death and resurrection.

Understanding this covenantal framework transforms our reading of the New Testament and reveals the beautiful, intentional design of God's redemptive plan. This is not simply a theological abstraction — it is the roadmap of salvation itself.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Two Baptisms, Two Covenants

| | Baptism of Repentance | Baptism of the Holy Spirit |
|---|---|---|
| **Covenant** | Old Covenant | New Covenant |
| **Agent** | John the Baptist (water) | Jesus Christ (Spirit & fire) |
| **Purpose** | Exit from the Old Covenant | Entrance into the New Covenant |
| **Nature** | Preparatory — points forward | Fulfillment — seals the believer |
| **Result** | Acknowledgment of sin | Indwelling of the Spirit |

### The Covenantal Progression

| Step | Stage | Scripture |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **The Law** — Reveals sin but cannot remove it | Romans 3:20, 2 Corinthians 3:6-7 |
| 2 | **Repentance** — The required turning point | Mark 1:4, Acts 19:4 |
| 3 | **The Spirit** — Seals into the New Covenant | Acts 2:38, 1 Corinthians 12:13 |
| 4 | **Grace** — Life under the New Covenant | Romans 6:14, Romans 8:1-2 |

## 🔑 The Truth

The two baptisms of the New Testament are not random rituals or disconnected events. They are covenantal markers that trace the path from death to life, from condemnation to freedom, from the Law to Grace. The baptism of repentance calls us out of the Old Covenant. The baptism of the Holy Spirit brings us into the New. And Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the one and established the other, is the center of it all.
